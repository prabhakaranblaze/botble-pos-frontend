## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start
```bash

flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# Delete database and restart
# Database location: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\StampSmartPOS\pos_local.db
```

### API Connection Errors
- Check `app_constants.dart` for correct API URL
- Verify API key is set correctly
- Ensure your Laravel API is running
- Check network connectivity

### Build Errors
```bash
# Update Flutter
flutter upgrade

# Get latest dependencies
flutter pub upgrade

# Rebuild
flutter build windows --release
```

## Sound Files (Optional)

Add these files to `assets/sounds/` for audio feedback:
- `beep.mp3` - Barcode scan success
- `error.mp3` - Error sound
- `success.mp3` - Checkout success

If sound files are missing, the app will continue to work without audio feedback.

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature folder in `lib/features/`
2. Add provider in feature folder
3. Register provider in `main.dart`
4. Add routes/navigation as needed

### Updating Models
1. Modify model in `lib/core/models/`
2. Update database schema if needed
3. Update API service methods
4. Test offline sync

## Performance Tips

1. **Use Release Mode** for production:
   ```bash
   flutter build windows --release
   ```

2. **Optimize Images**: Use compressed images for faster loading

3. **Limit Product Grid**: Pagination helps with large catalogs

4. **Regular Sync**: Close and reopen app daily to sync data

## Security

- Tokens are stored securely in encrypted storage
- API key should be kept secret
- Use HTTPS for API connections in production
- Implement proper access controls on the backend

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review Flutter documentation: https://docs.flutter.dev
3. Check API logs in your Laravel application
